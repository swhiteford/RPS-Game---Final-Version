# RPS-Game---Final-Version

This is the second ReadMe, as the previous one disappeared and the original game lost some functionality.  The old, previous version of Rock Paper Scissors Game is located here: https://github.com/swhiteford/RockPaperScissors---Susan

Introduction: The rules are: each participant chooses one of three shapes: "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

Rules: The rock smashes the scissors, the paper covers the rock, and the scissors cut the paper.  The game is tied if both players pick the same shape.

How to Play: The game begins with the player selecting one of three shapes: rock, paper, or scissors.  One of the three shapes is chosen at random by the computer.  

Game Over: When a player has won three rounds, the game is done.
